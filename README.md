### CI compilation is successful, but if you're still getting syntax errors while working locally, it's probably not a resource-related problem, it's a problem with your version of python.

A modular telegram Python user Bot that runs on a Python3 with a sqlalchemy database.

By taking the Bot from the PaperPlane base, it was translated into Turkish and several features were added. Fun features are taken from [SkittBot] (https://github.com/skittles9823/SkittBot). It is extremely modular and simple to use.

You can check the wiki page to configure this bot [Wiki] (https://github.com/TeamDerUntergang/Telegram-UserBot/wiki/Bot-Installation- Guide)

You can contact me at [support group] (https://t.me/SedenUserBotSupport) if you have any requests & complaints & suggestions.

Please go to the [Wiki] (https://github.com/TeamDerUntergang/Telegram-UserBot/wiki/Bot-Installation- Guide) for setup instructions! Questions given without reading the instruction will not be answered.
